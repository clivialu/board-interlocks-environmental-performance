## In plain language

This study examines whether companies that are connected through shared board members can learn from one another’s sustainability practices — a process known as *absorptive capacity*.  
We find that interlocking directorates can serve as important channels for transferring sustainability knowledge.  
Firms with greater absorptive capacity (stronger internal systems for learning and integration) benefit more from these connections, leading to improved environmental performance.  
The results highlight how board networks can indirectly foster better sustainability outcomes.
