## In Plain Language

This study examines whether companies that are connected through shared board members can learn from one another’s sustainability practices.  
We find that interlocking directorates can serve as important channels for transferring sustainability knowledge.  
Firms with greater absorptive capacity (stronger internal systems for learning and integration) benefit more from these connections, leading to improved environmental performance.  
The results highlight how board networks can indirectly foster better sustainability outcomes.

| # | Why it matters | What the paper delivers |
|---|---------------|-------------------------|
| **1** | **External knowledge × internal learning.** Boards connect firms to outside ideas, but value only materialises when the firm can absorb them. | Demonstrates that absorptive capacity (R&D intensity) amplifies the positive effect of board interlocks on environmental performance. |
| **2** | **Diversity pays.** Stakeholders look for evidence that firms learn beyond their echo-chamber. | Finds that a broader mix of interlocks (same-industry, cross-industry, and with environmental leaders) drives the biggest gains. |
| **3** | **Invest in R&D, not just talk.** Green rhetoric without capability risks failure. | Confirms higher R&D intensity directly improves environmental performance and moderates every interlock type. |
| **4** | **Large-scale, multi-sector evidence.** Managers want generalisable insights. | Analyses 4,526 firm-years across the S&P 1500 (2009-2018), spanning 16 NAICS sectors.  Regression shows total, same-industry, cross-industry, and leader interlocks all significantly boost environmental scores.|

### Managerial takeaways

* **Blend board reach with R&D depth.** Beef up R&D budgets so the organisation can translate insights flowing from directors’ external networks into concrete eco-innovations.  
* **Curate a mosaic of interlocks.** Seek directors who serve both within and outside your industry and on high-performing green firms to maximise learning spill-overs.   
* **Treat leaders as mentors.** Ties to top environmental performers provide a shortcut to best practices across sectors.  
* **Make the board the catalyst, not the bottleneck.** Push acquired knowledge down to operational teams via a robust environmental-management system (EMS).
